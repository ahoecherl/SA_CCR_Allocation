rate derivatives does have a significant flaw.

Obviously, \(\ln\left(P_i / K_i \right)\) is not defined, if \(P_i/K_i\)
is negative. This has, however been very commonplace in recent years,
especially for Euro swaptions. One can always set the fixed rate of the
underlying swap and therefore \(K_i\) as a negative value. But based on
the market data of the 10th of May 2019 it is even possible to yield
negative par rates for the underlying swap.

As an example we are plotting the zero and the 6M forward curve for the
EURIBOR 6M index below.
