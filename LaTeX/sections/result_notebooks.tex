    The purpose of this section is to document how the results presented primarily in section \ref{Results} were computed.
    For the purpose of this thesis a library has been implemented in Python and Java that can be found at \cite{Hoecherl2020}.
    This implemented library has a very similar architecture to the one presented in \ref{sec:Architectural blueprint for SA-CCR allocation}.
    Using this library, results for this thesis were computed within Jupyter Notebooks. These Jupyter notebooks are presented in this section. 
    Some, more technical notebook cells are not displayed for brevity.
