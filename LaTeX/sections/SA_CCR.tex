\section{SA-CCR}\label{SA-CCR}

Counterparty credit risk is considered to be a part of credit risk by the regulator. Risk weighted assets have to be calculated and need to be backed by own capital. The three main inputs for calculating credit risk are the probability of default (PD) the loss given default (LGD) and the exposure at default (EAD). Assuming the default of a counterparty over the course of the next year, the EAD is the current estimation of money indebted by the counterparty to the bank at the time of default. Estimating EAD for traditional credit instruments s.a. loans, credit cards, mortgages or bonds is relatively simple. Such instruments do often times have deterministic payment schedules making it easy to predict the exposure in one years time. Credit lines or credit cards behave less deterministic but it is still simple to determine an upper bound to the future exposure by assuming that the entire credit line is exhausted.
The counterparty credit risk incurred by derivatives has first been regarded in regulatory capital calculation in Basel II \cite{basel2}. Due to the stochastic nature of derivatives EAD calculation for counterparty credit risk has always been regulated separately ever since. Consideration of \gls{CCR} in regulatory capital was overhauled as part of Basel III \todo{proper citation needed}. The regulation for the internal margin model (\gls{IMM}) approach was adjusted and the current exposure model (\gls{CEM}) that was introduced with Basel II as the standard approach for \gls{CCR} \gls{EAD} calculation was replaced with the \gls{SA-CCR} model and the simplified \gls{SA-CCR} model. \todo{Include timeline of SA-CCR regulatory documents}.

The \gls{SA-CCR} model was implemented for the analysis section of this thesis but will not be presented in a comprehensive fashion here. Instead the reader may refer to the latest regulatory documents \todo{CRD2 document} and \todo{latest EBA update} or the library developed for this thesis \cite{Hoecherl2020}.
This section will highlight the aspects of the SA-CCR model and the simplified SA-CCR model that are of special interest within the scope of this thesis such as the consideration of margin. 

\subsection{Calculation of SA-CCR}

When using SA-CCR the exposure at default has to be
calculated as:

\begin{align}
	\begin{split}
		EAD &= \alpha * (RC + PFE)\\
		\\
		\text{where} \qquad \alpha&=1.4 \\
		RC&: \text{Replacement Cost} \\
		PFE&: \text{Potential Future Exposure}
	\end{split}
\end{align}

The purpose of the RC is to assess the immediate loss suffered by the
default of a counterparty. It is based on the current MtM of the
derivative less the accessible collateral. If a bank has posted
collateral to non-segregated accounts of a counterparty this collateral
is also assumed to be lost in case of a default which increases the
replacement cost.
The potential future exposure (PFE) on the other hand assesses how the
RC might develop in the future. The future being defined as during the
next year. If the RC today is 0 but is likely to be larger than 0 in the
near future the estimated EAD should take this expected increase in RC
into account.

See also Paragraph 130 and 131 of \cite{SACCR}

    Paragraph 130 - case without margining:

\begin{quote}
For unmargined transactions, the \emph{RC} intends to capture the loss
that would occur if a counterparty were to default and were closed out
of its transactions immediately. The \emph{PFE} add-on represents a
potential conservative increase in exposure over a one-year time horizon
from the present date (i.e.~the calculation date).
\end{quote}

Paragraph 131 - case with margining:

\begin{quote}
For margined trades, the \emph{RC} intends to capture the loss that
would occur if a counterparty were to default at the present or at a
future time, assuming that the closeout and replacement of transactions
occur instantaneously. However, there may be a period (the margin period
of risk) between the last exchange of collateral before default and
replacement of the trades in the market. The \emph{PFE} add-on
represents the potential change in value of the trades during this time
period.
\end{quote}

The PFE is defined as
\begin{align}
	\begin{split}
		PFE &= \text{multiplier} * AddOn^{\text{agg}} \\
		\\
		\text{where} \qquad AddOn^{\text{agg}} &: \text{aggregate add-on component} \\
		\text{multiplier} &: f(V,C,AddOn^{\text{agg}})
	\end{split}
\end{align}

\(AddOn\) is calculated differently for each asset \(a\) class. Since no
netting is allowed between asset classes the aggregate is calculated as:

\[AddOn^{\text{agg}} = \sum_{a}AddOn^{a}\]

Collateralization is taken into account of the PFE calculation through
the multiplier that uses the collateral held as an input. As
overcollateralization increases, the multiplier
decreases. The most important source of overcollateralization is initial margin. However, the multiplier is floored at 5\%.

\begin{flalign}
	\begin{split}
		\text{multiplier} &= \min \left\{ 1; Floor + (1-Floor) \exp\left(\frac{V-C}{2(1-Floor)AddOn^{\text{agg}}}\right) \right\} \\
		\text{where } Floor &= 5\%		
	\end{split}
\end{flalign}

It is important to note that the multiplier can only be below 1 if
\(C>V\), i.e.~if the portfolio is overcollateralized. If the portfolio
is overcollateralized, the \emph{AddOn} comes into play. The idea behind
the \emph{AddOn} is related to the idea of value at risk. The higher the
\emph{AddOn} the faster the SA-CCR model expects the positions to lose
in value. Therefore, the higher the value, the higher the multiplier.
