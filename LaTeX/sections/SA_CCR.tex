\section{SA-CCR}\label{SA-CCR}

Counterparty credit risk is considered to be a part of credit risk by the regulator. Risk weighted assets have to be calculated and need to be backed by own capital. The three main inputs for calculating credit risk are the probability of default (PD) the loss given default (LGD) and the exposure at default (EAD). Assuming the default of a counterparty over the course of the next year, the EAD is the current estimation of money indebted by the counterparty to the bank at the time of default. Estimating EAD for traditional credit instruments s.a. loans, credit cards, mortgages or bonds is relatively simple. Such instruments do often times have deterministic payment schedules making it easy to predict the exposure in one years time. Credit lines or credit cards behave less deterministic but it is still simple to determine an upper bound to the future exposure by assuming that the entire credit line is exhausted.
The counterparty credit risk incurred by derivatives has first been regarded in regulatory capital calculation in Basel II \cite{basel2}. Due to the stochastic nature of derivatives, EAD calculation for counterparty credit risk has always been regulated separately ever since. Consideration of \gls{CCR} in regulatory capital was overhauled as part of Basel III \cite{CRE}. The regulation for the internal margin model (\gls{IMM}) approach was adjusted and the current exposure model (\gls{CEM}) that was introduced with Basel II as the standard approach for \gls{CCR} \gls{EAD} calculation was replaced with the \gls{SA-CCR} model and the simplified \gls{SA-CCR} model.

The \gls{SA-CCR} model was implemented to yield the results presented in chapter \ref{sec:Results} of this thesis but the structure of the \gls{SA-CCR} model will not be presented in a comprehensive fashion here. Instead the reader may refer to the latest regulatory documents \cite[Article 274 and following]{CRRII} and \cite{EBA_2019} or the library developed for this thesis \cite{Hoecherl2020}.
This section will highlight the aspects of the SA-CCR model that are of special interest within the scope of this thesis such as the consideration of margin. 

\subsection{Consideration of margining in SA-CCR}

When using SA-CCR the exposure at default has to be
calculated as:

\begin{align}
	\begin{split}
		EAD &= \alpha * (RC + PFE)\\
		\\
		\text{where} \qquad \alpha&=1.4 \\
		RC&: \text{Replacement Cost} \\
		PFE&: \text{Potential Future Exposure}
	\end{split}
	\label{eq:SA-CCR EAD}
\end{align}

The purpose of the RC is to assess the immediate loss suffered by the
default of a counterparty. It is based on the current MtM of the
derivative less the accessible collateral. If a bank has posted
collateral to non-segregated accounts of a counterparty this collateral
is also assumed to be lost in case of a default which increases the
replacement cost.
The potential future exposure (PFE) on the other hand assesses how the
RC might develop in the future. The future being defined as during the
next year. If the RC today is zero but is likely to be larger than zero in the
near future the estimated EAD should take this expected increase in RC
into account.

See also Paragraph 130 and 131 of \cite{SACCR}

    Paragraph 130 - case without margining:

\begin{quote}
For unmargined transactions, the \emph{RC} intends to capture the loss
that would occur if a counterparty were to default and were closed out
of its transactions immediately. The \emph{PFE} add-on represents a
potential conservative increase in exposure over a one-year time horizon
from the present date (i.e.~the calculation date).
\end{quote}

Paragraph 131 - case with margining:

\begin{quote}
For margined trades, the \emph{RC} intends to capture the loss that
would occur if a counterparty were to default at the present or at a
future time, assuming that the closeout and replacement of transactions
occur instantaneously. However, there may be a period (the margin period
of risk) between the last exchange of collateral before default and
replacement of the trades in the market. The \emph{PFE} add-on
represents the potential change in value of the trades during this time
period.
\end{quote}

The PFE is defined as
\begin{align}
	\begin{split}\label{eq:PFE}
		PFE &= \text{multiplier} * AddOn^{\text{agg}} \\
		\\
		\text{where} \qquad AddOn^{\text{agg}} &: \text{aggregate add-on component} \\
		\text{multiplier} &: f(V,C,AddOn^{\text{agg}})
	\end{split}
\end{align}

\(AddOn\) is calculated differently for each asset class \(a\). Since no
netting is allowed between asset classes the aggregate is calculated as:

\[AddOn^{\text{agg}} = \sum_{a}AddOn^{a}\]

Collateralization is taken into account of the PFE calculation through
the multiplier that uses the collateral held as an input. As
overcollateralization increases, the multiplier
decreases. The most important source of overcollateralization is initial margin. However, the multiplier is floored at 5\%.

\begin{flalign}
	\begin{split}
		\text{multiplier} &= \min \left\{ 1; Floor + (1-Floor) \exp\left(\frac{V-C}{2(1-Floor)AddOn^{\text{agg}}}\right) \right\} \\
		\text{where } Floor &= 5\%		
	\end{split}
	\label{eq:multiplier}
\end{flalign}

The RC is defined as
\begin{align}
	\begin{split}\label{eq:RC}
		RC &= \max\{V-C; TH+MTA-NICA;0\} \\
		\\
		\text{where} \qquad V&: \text{Current portfolio value}\\
		C&: \text{Net collateral held}\\ 
		TH&: \text{Threshold} \\
		MTA&: \text{Minimum Transfer Amount} \\
		NICA&: \text{Net Independent Collateral Amount}
	\end{split}
\end{align}

\(C\) is defined according to the \emph{NICA} definition, which is defined in paragraph 143 of \cite{SACCR}. For the purpose of this thesis we simplify the \emph{NICA} definition by making assumption \ref{as:Collateral assumptions}.

\begin{assumption}\label{as:Collateral assumptions}
Variation margin is posted in unsegregated accounts, initial margin is posted in segregated accounts and initial margin is the only form of overcollateralization.
\end{assumption}

Under assumption \ref{as:Collateral assumptions}, the calculation of \(NICA\) and \(C\) simplifies to:

\begin{align}
	\begin{split}
		C&= \text{Variation Margin balance} + NICA\\ 
		NICA&= \text{Received initial margin}
	\end{split}
\end{align}

Regarding the incorporation of a variation margin and initial margin threshold and a MTA we will assume that the mechanics are the following:
\begin{enumerate}
	\item A threshold TH\textsubscript{VM} may exist if only VM is exchanged but no IM
	\item No threshold for the exchange of variation margin TH\textsubscript{VM} can be in place if initial margin is exchanged
	\item A threshold TH\textsubscript{IM} for initial margin may exist 
	\item If $ IM_{calc} > \text{TH\textsubscript{IM}} + \text{MTA} $ then $IM_{calc} - \text{TH\textsubscript{IM}} $ is posted as collateral to cover the initial margin
	\item A possible MTA applies for the combined change of VM and IM
\end{enumerate}

These are the usual rules in place in margin agreements applicable for the case of bilateral derivatives collateralized with VM and IM and are in line with the minimum requirements by the regulators \cite{BCBS_MarginRequirements}.
In line with these rules the received collateral C can be calculated as follows:

\begin{align}
	% \begin{split}
		VM &= \begin{cases}
			\sum_t{P(t)} \; & \text{if } \; \left|\sum_t{P(t)}\right| > \text{TH\textsubscript{VM}} \\
			0 & \text{else}
		\end{cases}\nonumber \\
	% \end{split} \\
	IM_{rec} &= \max{(0, IM_{\text{calc}}-\text{TH\textsubscript{IM}})} \nonumber \\
	C_{calc} &= VM + IM_{rec} \nonumber \\
	\begin{split}
		C_t &= \begin{cases}
			C_{t-1} & \text{if } \; |C_t-C_{\text{calc}}| < MTA\\
			C_{calc} \; &\text{else} 
		\end{cases}\label{eq:C}
	\end{split}\\
	\nonumber \\
	\text{where} \qquad P(t) &: \text{Present value of trade $t$} \nonumber \\
	\text{IM\textsubscript{calc}} &: \text{calculated \gls{IM} to be received } \nonumber \\
	\text{TH\textsubscript{VM}} &: \text{Variation Margin Threshold} \nonumber \\
	\text{TH\textsubscript{IM}} &: \text{Initial Margin Threshold} \nonumber \\
	MTA &: \text{Minimum transfer amount} \nonumber \\
	C_{t-1} &: \text{$C$ calculated in last time period} \nonumber
\end{align}

Considering thresholds and a possible minimum transfer amount we yield the formulas depicted in table \ref{tab:Margin in SA-CCR} for some key figures of the \gls{SA-CCR} model.

The case that is analyzed the most in this thesis is \ref{itm:Bilateral derivatives collateralized with VM and IM}. It is important to note that assuming the absence of a minimum transfer amount, the \(RC\) is always floored at zero in this case and a change in VM or IM then only impacts the \gls{SA-CCR} \gls{EAD} through the use of \(C\) in the multiplier calculation of equation \ref{eq:multiplier}.

The multiplier is therefore the central point of focus when analyzing the interaction between SA-CCR and margin. The multiplier function is plotted in figure \ref{fig:multiplier}.
The multiplier is ceiled at one if \(C>V\), i.e.~if the portfolio is overcollateralized which under assumption \ref{as:Collateral assumptions} is the case when the bank receives \gls{IM}. With increasing overcollateralization the multiplier drops and approaches its floor of 5\%. The other factor that drives the multiplier is the portfolios \(AddOn\). 

The $AddOn$ is a portfolio metric that is supposed to represent how quickly the value of the portfolio can rise within the \gls{MPoR}. The underlying idea is similar to a value at risk and the $AddOn$ is designed to be easy to compute while still being portfolio based and taking optionalities into account. Margining does not impact the calculated $AddOn$. Therefore, $AddOn$ calculation for SA-CCR is not presented in great detail at this point. The reader is referred to \cite[Article 280]{CRRII} and the library that was implemented for the purpose of this thesis \cite{Hoecherl2020}.

% It is important to note that the multiplier can only be below 1 if
% \(C>V\), i.e.~if the portfolio is overcollateralized. If the portfolio
% is overcollateralized, the \emph{AddOn} comes into play. The idea behind
% the \emph{AddOn} is related to the idea of value at risk. The higher the
% \emph{AddOn} the faster the SA-CCR model expects the positions to lose
% in value. Therefore, the higher the value, the higher the multiplier.
