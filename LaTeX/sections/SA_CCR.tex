\subsection{Capital requirements for counterparty credit risk}
Counterparty credit risk is considered to be a part of credit risk by the regulator. Risk weighted assets have to be calculated and need to be backed by own capital. The three main inputs for calculating credit risk are the probability of default (PD) the loss given default (LGD) and the exposure at default (EAD). Assuming the default of a counterparty over the course of the next year, the EAD is the current estimation of money indebted by the counterparty to the bank at the time of default. Estimating EAD for traditional credit instruments s.a. loans, credit cards, mortgages or bonds is relatively simple. Such instruments do often times have deterministic payment schedules making it easy to predict the exposure in one years time. Credit lines or credit cards behave less deterministic but it is still simple to determine an upper bound to the future exposure by assuming that the entire credit line is exhausted.
The counterparty credit risk incurred by derivatives has first been regarded in regulatory capital calculation in Basel II \cite{basel2}.
Due to the stochastic nature of derivatives EAD calculation for counterparty credit risk has always been regulated separately ever since 
To calculate the counterparty credit risk associated with derivatives a different approach to calculating
