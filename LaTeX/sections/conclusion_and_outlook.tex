    \section{Outlook\label{sec:Outlook}}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Perform under CCP margining
        \item Try analytical solution or with adjoint algorithmic differentiation
        \item Investigate further into risk sensitive solutions for the described edge cases in section \ref{sec:Consideration of edge cases} to find solutions that maintain risk sensitive character
        \item Investigate if in some cases Shapley allocation might be of help and discuss possibilities to counter its prohibitively expensive computational requirements
    \end{itemize}
